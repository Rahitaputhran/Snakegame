This project is a beginner-friendly implementation of the classic Snake Game in Java. It uses Swing and AWT libraries for a graphical interface, where players can control a green snake moving across the board. The objective is to guide the snake to collect food, causing it to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls or its own body. The game ends upon collision, and the goal is to achieve the highest possible score.
## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
