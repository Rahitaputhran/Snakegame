This project is a beginner-friendly implementation of the classic Snake Game in Java. It uses Swing and AWT libraries for a graphical interface, where players can control a green snake moving across the board. The objective is to guide the snake to collect food, causing it to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls or its own body. The game ends upon collision, and the goal is to achieve the highest possible score.
